### About

This is the backend piece that does the interaction with the database, runs recorded steps, deals with 2FA, writes into Google Spreadsheet.

Note this is written for locally hosted eg. 192 addresses. But you could host it somehwere/point the Chrome Extension to that url.

See this project of mine that has a [remote secured webserver](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/chrome-extension-notetaking-reminder-app/tree/remote-origin-iframe) (NGINX, Let's Encrypt, MySQL type DB, Node)
