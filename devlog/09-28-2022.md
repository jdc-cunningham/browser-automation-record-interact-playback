So... I've been down lately, two weeks or more.

Starting to get motivated again to do things.

This a project that I need to complete but kind of dreading, so will plan and split up the work.

I'll definitely go for MVP ugly but works

I still feel beat/lethargic... so will see how it goes.

I'm still cheating right now (directly accessing apps and manually entering values into spreadsheet)
